* CSC435 Compiler
This implements up to assignment 3 of CSC435. 
The compiler uses an antlr grammar, an implemented AST, a pretty print visitor, and a type check visitor. This includes the bonus of interpreting int as a subtype of float.  
The resulting AST is then converted to IR by the IRVisitor. This IR is outputted in tests/ir/<filename>.ir

** Commands:
- make to build
- java Compiler filename.ul to compile a ul file 
- java PrettyPrinter filename.ul to pretty print a ul file using the compiler
- run_tests.sh runs make and all test cases

when a file, ie filename.ul, is compiled:
1. Any errors will be printed to the screen
2. The resulting IR will be output to the directory tests/ir, ie tests/ir/filename.ir
