* CSC435 Compiler
This implements up to assignment 2 of CSC435. The compiler uses an antlr grammar, an implemented AST, a pretty print visitor, and a type check visitor. This includes the bonus of interpreting int as a subtype of float.  
  
** Commands:
- make to build
- java Compiler filename.ul to compile a ul file (now including Type Checking!)
- java PrettyPrinter filename.ul to pretty print a ul file using the compiler
- run_tests.sh runs make and all test cases
